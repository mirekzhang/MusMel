Jells Park Photo Walk :: In the Footsteps of Clarice Beckett,"Clarise Beckett was a tonalist painter, in the Max Meldrum tradition, who painted many works around Beaumaris. Her work may not be widely known but embraced many aspects of tonalism, minimalism in a modernist way. This walk will visit places both she and the Heildelberg School Impressionists painted and look at tonal balance in the way a photo can be composed. Hopefully you?ll also get a chance to photograph a variety of water birds, beach scenes and some traditional (less colourful) beach boxes. ?A painter should begin every canvas with a wash of black, because all things in nature are dark except where exposed by the light.?ÿ ?ÿLeonardo da Vinci",57070435208,https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/jells-park-photo-walk-in-the-footsteps-of-clarice-beckett-tickets-57070435208?aff=ebapi,5/15/2019,10:30 AM,5/15/2019,12:00 PM,"Clarise Beckett was a tonalist painter, in the Max Meldrum tradition, who painted many works around Beaumaris.
