"Australian student mobility to the Indo-Pacific region: Policy, practice and future implications","Education Thought Leader Series Deakin University?s strategic research centre in education, Research for Educational Impact (REDI), is delighted to host a public lecture series in 2019 featuring our Thought Leaders engaging with today?s big questions in education. Our research addresses local and global challenges in education, and our Thought Leaders seek to make a difference to society and culture by engaging with today?s big questions and conducting research that impacts educational theory, policy, teacher practice and student learning. This inaugural lecture will be presented by Associate Professor Ly Tran, REDI Thought Leader and recently named by Forbes Vietnam among Vietnam's 50 most influential women for her research into Vietnamese higher education reform and international student mobility. Associate Professor Tran has devoted her career to higher education, graduate employability, diversity and the teaching and learning of international students, with a focus on building connections between Australia and Vietnam through education.  Australian student mobility to the Indo-Pacific region: Policy, practice and future implications Associate Professor Ly Tran International student mobility is critical to Australia's social and economic development, soft diplomacy and connections with the Indo-Pacific region.  The number of Australian students participating in study abroad has increased sixfold over the last 10 years. About one in five Australian students undertakes study or internships overseas during their undergraduate program.  As a signature initiative of public diplomacy and a form of reciprocal international education, the New Colombo Plan embraces the government?s commitment for young Australians to be exposed to, make connections with and learn from Indo-Pacific neighbours. By 2020, the New Colombo Plan will have sent around 40,000 Australian students to the Indo-Pacific.  Please join Associate Professor Ly Tran as she discusses the policy context for Australia?s outbound mobility with a focus on the New Colombo Plan, and provides comparisons with some international policy settings and trends on student mobility. She will then present key findings of a Future Fellowship project funded by the Australian Research Council that explores impacts of Australian student mobility to the Indo-Pacific on student development, institutional connections, government relationships and regional engagement from the perspectives of both home and host countries.    Associate Professor Ly Tran Ly Tran is an Associate Professor in the School of Education, Deakin University and is an Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Fellow. Ly's research focuses on international students across the school, vocational education and training (VET) and higher education (HE) sectors, student mobility, the New Colombo Plan and staff professional learning in international education. Ly also undertakes projects on higher education, vocational education and graduate employability in Vietnam and China. Ly has been awarded five grants on international student mobility, internationalising teaching and learning and staff professional development in international education from the ARC. Ly?s book, ?Teaching international students in vocational education: New pedagogical approaches? won the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA) Excellence Award for Best Practice/Innovation in International Education (https://shop.acer.edu.au/teaching-international-students-in-vocational-education).  Ly has produced more than 150 publications (published and in press) in a wide range of outlets and been invited to speak at various national and international conferences on key issues related to international student experiences, student mobility, the New Colombo Plan, the teaching of international students and education in Vietnam. Ly was recently nominated as one of Vietnam's 50 most influential women by Forbes Vietnam.

Animals can be used to further harm and control women/victims, and in reverse, many women report delays in leaving a violent situation or returning to an unsafe home in order to care for a beloved family pet or stock animals. At the University of Melbourne,˜researchers are working collaboratively˜with members of the veterinary profession, other academics and domestic violence organisations to build better evidence about the impact of domestic violence on animals. This is from both the human and animal perspectives. This panel will present information about the programs in place as well as the data and theory in the field so far.˜˜Members of the discussion panel include practitioners working to support families in domestic violence crisis, veterinarians, academic researchers and the peak organisation focussing on the intersection of domestic violence and animals, Lucy?s Project.

When not instilling the love of history in students, Steve?s passion is in the built environment; strategic planning; history and geography.˜ His role on Council has enabled him to pursue his commitment to the preservation and protection of heritage buildings, areas and streetscapes and to work towards his vision for the preparation of long-term strategic plans for the development of major infrastructure projects for his beloved City of Stonnington. As Mayor, Steve has also worked passionately to ensure that the City of Stonnington is inclusive and accessible to all, especially the LGBTIQ+ community.˜ During his two terms as Mayor, Steve has lent his support to, and raised the profile of, a number of LGBTIQ+˜groups, attending and speaking at various functions and activities; providing fundraising opportunities; encouraging the use of Council facilities through community grants and, through his Mayoral Gala in October 2019, hopes to raise much needed funds for the Victorian Pride Centre.?

Parent Seminar Series: Emotional Intelligence and Friendships,"Please join us for our Parent Seminar on Emotional Intelligence and Friendships with guest speaker Maryanne Kapoulitsas. Friendships are complex interpersonal networks that are developed during early childhood and refined during the middle childhood and adolescent years. The process by which friendship skills are tried and tested includes emotional highs and lows which can be tough to observe as a parent. There is strong evidence to show the value of developing emotional competencies for growing healthy and secure friendships. Maryanne will provide practical strategies for parents to support their daughters to develop skills to effectively identify, understand, regulate and use emotions to develop and maintain healthy and genuine friendships with peers. Maryanne is an Emotional Intelligence Schools Consultant from Swinburne University. Tickets: This is a free event. Please reserve your place here.
