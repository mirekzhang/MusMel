"Bruised: Art Action and Ecology - Urban Farming, Local Action","Join the conversation about urban farming and local action. How can you become self sufficient with food if you live in the middle of a large city? What actions can you make that will create change for the better? Bjorn Low, co-founder of Edible Garden City, an urban farming social enterprise in Singapore, joins Dr Alban Mannisi, Landscape Urbanist and senior academic, RMIT, to discuss becoming self sufficient within the limitations. This conversation is part of RMIT Gallery's Bruised: Art Action and Ecology in Asia exhibition, which examines how artists are using creative actions to open discussions around food sustainability and production, environmental catastrophes and human migration in our region.  Bjorn Low is part of a growing urban farming scene. Edible Garden City makes use of under-utilised spaces in Singapore, where the land used for agriculture makes up less than one per cent of the total land area. Bjorn and his team have built gardens on the rooftops of buildings around the city. They are sharing the ideology of a movement building a sustainable urban farming industry in Singapore. Bruised: Art Action and Ecology in Asiaÿis part of the of ART+CLIMATE=CHANGE 2019 23 April?19 May, a socially-engaged festival of exhibitions, theatre works, keynote lectures, events and artist talks considering climate change impacts and the challenges and opportunities arising from climate change.
