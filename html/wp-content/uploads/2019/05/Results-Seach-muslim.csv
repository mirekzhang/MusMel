Indonesia Tanpa Feminisme,"In mid-March 2019, Indonesian netizens and public was struck by the advent of an Instagram account with the account name: @Indonesiatanpafeminis (Indonesia without feminism). As controversial as the tagline is, this account states that ?my body is not mine, but rather Allah?s?.  The idea to regulate women?s body, and whose ownership is it, had indeed been stretched for centuries since the dawn of civilization. Religions and cultural groups around the world put women?s body as battleground because from women?s body, lie their future generations. In modern time, nevertheless, the idea of regulating women?s body and claiming ownership of women?s body are still deemed important. Debates around women and their place in society seem to be one of the most contested affairs in many societies around the world.  As the most populated Muslim country, debates in Indonesia is highly dominated by political Islamist groups, such as those who initiated the @Indonesiatanpafeminis account. Due to heavy emphasis on religious and cultural debates on women?s body, the issue of women?s sexuality and reproductive health remains half-heartedly managed in policy, as it is easily clashed with the conservative views on the role of women in public and/or private spheres. One of the battleground is RUU PKS (Rancangan Undang-undang Penghapusan Kekerasan Seksual ? Proposed Bill on the Elimination of Sexual Violence), where the debate is heavily framed in religious aspect instead. Meanwhile, some proxy indicators related to women reproductive health in Indonesia, such as maternal mortality, is still poor. Indonesia?s maternal mortality rate is the third worst in ASEAN after Myanmar and Lao PDR, at 190 per 100,000 live births. Lack of knowledge regarding their own body and sexuality or reproductive processes, leads to high cases of unwanted pregnancy and other harmful activity such as unsafe abortion that in the end, causing maternal death. In some culture and religions, the solution offered is early marriage (e.g. @Indonesia tanpa pacaran). In another cultural context, women have less voice even in deciding how many children they want, how they want to give birth or where: men and the big family decide for them.  We expect to discuss the issue of ?Indonesia tanpa feminisme?, from the perspective of feminism, religion and their influence in social and political realm of the country, as well as from the perspective of women?s sexuality and reproductive health situation in Indonesia. Speakers: 1. DR. Dina Afrianty Dina is a Research Fellow at La Trobe Law School, Melbourne. She writes a recent article titled ?Women and Islam in Contemporary Indonesia? and previously publishes numbers of articles and books on gender, Islam and politics in Indonesia. Dina will discuss the topic from the angle of Islam and feminism in Indonesia. 2. Yuni Asrianty Yuni is a member of Komnas Perempuan and currently pursuing her master?s degree in Gender and Development at the University of Melbourne. She will discuss the topic from the angle of Indonesian gender activism and the involvement of religious group supporters in public policy making pertaining to women and gender affairs. 3. A/Prof. Linda Bennett Linda is based at the Nossal Institute for Global Health, in the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health. Her recent article titled ?Contestations of Gender, Sexuality and Morality in Contemporary Indonesia? and her book titled: ?Seksualitas di Indonesia? give a picture about the entanglement of sexual health and perception of religion and morality in Indonesia.

Keywords for India: Violence,"Keywords for India Public Lecture Series  About the talk Concerns about public order, communal violence and disobedience have been central to policing and public policies in India since the trauma of Partition in 1947. In this lecture, Professor Thomas Blom Hansen will highlight how ?public violence? ? demonstrations of anger and community strength ? have become ever more legitimate forms of political expression in modern India. The talk will focus on two forms of violence, both of which thrive amidst a flourishing electoral democracy.  First, ?communal violence?, especially pogroms, attacks and lynching, perpetrated by Hindus against Muslims, have dramatically accelerated in recent decades. Most of these pogroms have been orchestrated by Hindu nationalist organizations who have also decisively changed the public perception of communal violence and minorities in a more Hindu-majoritarian direction.  Second, Professor Hansen will focus on how ?ordinary violence? has become a routine element in public service delivery, neighbourhood conflicts and frustration with public officials. According to the National Crime Bureau in India in 2016, 80% of all serious public disturbances in the country belong to this category of ?ordinary violence, that results in the injury, arrest and imprisonment of hundreds of thousands each year in India. About the speaker Thomas Blom Hansen, Chair and Professor, Department of Anthropology, Stanford University. Thomas Hansen is the Reliance-Dhirubhai Ambani Professor in South Asian Studies and Professor in Anthropology. He is also the Director of Stanford?s Center for South Asia where he is charged with building a substantial new program. He has many and broad interests spanning South Asia and Southern Africa, several cities and multiple theoretical and disciplinary interests from political theory and continental philosophy to psychoanalysis, comparative religion and contemporary urbanism. Much of Professor Hansen?s fieldwork was done during the tumultuous and tense years in the beginning of the 1990s when conflicts between Hindu militants and Muslims defined national agendas and produced frequent violent clashes in the streets. Out of this work came two books: The Saffron Wave. Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India (Princeton 1999) which explores the larger phenomenon of Hindu nationalism in the light of the dynamics of India?s democratic experience, and Wages of Violence: Naming and Identity in Postcolonial Bombay (Princeton 2001) which explores the historical processes and contemporary conflicts that led to the rise of violent socioreligious conflict and the renaming of the city in 1995. During the last decade, Professor Hansen has pursued a detailed study of religious revival, racial conflict and transformation of domestic and intimate life from the 1950s to the present in a formerly Indian township in Durban, South Africa. This round of work has now resulted in a book entitled Melancholia of Freedom: Anxiety, Race and Everyday Life in a South African Township (Princeton University Press, 2012). In addition to these ethnographic engagements, Professor Hansen has pursued a number of theoretical interests in the anthropology of the state, sovereignty, violence and urban life. This has resulted in a range of co-edited volumes, and special issues of journals such as Critique of Anthropology and African Studies. He is currently working on a collection of theoretical and ethnographic essays provisionally entitled Public Passions and Modern Convictions.",57668399736,https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/keywords-for-india-violence-tickets-57668399736?aff=ebapi,5/14/2019,6:00 PM,5/14/2019,7:00 PM,"Keywords for India Public Lecture Series  About the talk Concerns about public order, communal violence and disobedience have been central t",57650951,1170296127,31859370,112,https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/57668399736/,https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F57650951%2F15835790977%2F1%2Foriginal.20190301-011319?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C0%2C4320%2C2160&s=186755c912f5026ae9e29626cf0595a7
Anger management: The ?injured majority? and the rise of Hindu nationalism,"Since U.N. Mukerji published his book ?Hindus ? a Dying Race? in 1909, demographic anxieties and the fear of ?Hindu weakness? have been driving forces in the making of Hindu nationalism in the 20th century. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the central organization in the Hindu nationalist movement, was set up in 1925 to ?defend? and unify Hindus across the subcontinent, and to impart discipline and physical courage to Hindu men in the face of a constant threat from Muslims.  These pre-independence sentiments of Hindu weakness, disunity and historical injury remain cornerstones in the contemporary Hindu nationalist movement in India that today dominate Indian politics and Indian society in unprecedented ways. Even at the current height of its power and influence, BJP and affiliates campaign relentlessly on the constant threats from Muslims: ?love jihad?, cow slaughter, ?anti-national? conspiracies, and military threats from Pakistan. This specter of constant threats is, in turn, deployed to justify ?Hindu anger? and the proliferation of vigilante violence against Muslims and other minorities, artists and critics of the BJP. This ubiquitous threat of violence that hangs over much of Indian society is probably the gravest threat to the future of Indian democracy. ˜   Thomas Blom Hansen is the Reliance-Dhirubhai Ambani Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University.
