Each volunteer will be allocated a tree or ?stag? to watch for one hour at sunset and will record any animals they observe emerging or entering nest boxes and hollows. This valuable data helps our biodiversity staff to monitor native animal populations, nest box usage and peak activity times in the Sanctuary.ÿ Registrations are essential and numbers are limited. Registrations will open approx 4 weeks prior to the event and will close 12pm on the day before the event.   FAQs Can I get tickets for multiple people? Definitely! However, as we need names of each person attending the event, we do require each person to register separately. Do I need any specialised knowledge or skills? No! While we love to have volunteers who have a background knowledge of our local flora and fauna, it is not essential. Each citizen science event starts with a briefing to let you know what you will be doing. ÿCan children attend this event? There is no minimum age requirement to take part in this citizen science event, but please be mindful that our volunteers are generally required to either sit either record calls or observe wildlife. So, providing children can sit quietly in the dark for an expended period of time with out getting bored, they are welcome to attend. Childrenÿmust be accompanied by an adult at all times.ÿ Why do you need name and mobile number for each person? You will be heading into the Sanctuary after dark, so as a safety precaution we accurate details (name and contact number) for each person attending the event. The mobile number is so that we can contact you in the event of an emergency.ÿ I can't stay until the end of the event, am I able to leave early? Due to the way we run these events, we need you to be able to stay until the scheduled finish time. If you were to leave early then you may not be able to do the survey for the allocated time or you may interupt other groups who are recording at a different site. ÿHow can I contact the organiser with any questions?

World Environment Day planting,"At this large planting you can take action to help nature and celebrate World Environment Day. The Mt Ridley Nature Conservation Reserve needs more mid-storey tree and shrub species to create habitat for small woodland birds. Some of these beautiful woodland birds are becoming quite rare to find, yet play a very important role by controlling infestations of sap-sucking lerp insects, which impact on the health of the majestic River Red Gums. Join in with corporate volunteers from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), National Australia Bank (NAB), and other community members. Pizzas are on offer for lunch, or please bring you own lunch if you have special dietary requirements. FAQs Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event? Hume City Council's Greening events are free family-friendly and child-safe activities, with people of all ages and backgrounds welcomed. Participants up to the ages of 85 are covered by Council's Personal Accident Insurance policy, but participants older than 85 years are NOT covered and participate at their own risk. Children must be supervised by their parent or guardian at all times. Please register your attendance on the event sign-in sheet and follow the event supervisor's safe working instructions.ÿ What are my transport/parking options for getting to and from the event? Car-parking is usually available on the surrounding streets to the planting site, or at designated reserve carparks.ÿ For public transport options, check the PTV Journey Planner atÿhttp://jp.ptv.vic.gov.au/ What can I bring into the event? Please wear old comfortable clothing that you wouldn't mind getting dirty, with safe enclosed shoes. Consider if you need to bring a rain jacket or a sun-smart hat. Bring a drink bottle (water, tea and coffee will be provided) and your own packed lunch if you have any special dietary requirements (a simple BBQ lunch or pizzas are catered for lunch, with fruit snacks). All the other tools, equipment and materials required will be provided by Council, including gloves and sunscreen.ÿ When will events be cancelled? Greening events will be cancelled if there is bad weather forecast, including heavy rain, thunderstorms or gale force winds. However light drizzling rain is great planting weather and the event will go ahead if people arrive (check the rain radar on http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR023.loop.shtml#skip). Council staff are normally out on site about an hour before the event commences, setting up.ÿ How can I contact the organiser with any questions?
