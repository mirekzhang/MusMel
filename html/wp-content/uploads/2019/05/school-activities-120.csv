Deakin University School of Exercise and Nutrition VCE PE Program,"VCE Physical Education: Turning theory into practice\nDeakin University?s School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences offers VCE Physical Education classes the opportunity to gain an insight into exercise science testing and evaluation in a laboratory or clinical environment at our Melbourne Burwood Campus.\nThe program offers you, as a physical education teacher, a great opportunity to reinforce aspects of the VCE curriculum, using Deakin University?s first class performance laboratories. Students will interact with sport scientists whilst conducting and interpreting a range of laboratory tests. Schools may choose one or both of the laboratory sessions as well as take a tour of other facilities within the University.\n\nLab 1: Physiological assessment of exercise\nLinked to VCE Physical Education Unit 1: The Human Body in Motion, and Unit 3: Movement Skills and Energy for Physical Activity.Area of Study: How does the body produce energy?\nIn this lab, students will explore common laboratory methods to assess aerobic and anaerobic fitness. Aerobic capacity will be assessed using a progressive exercise test to exhaustion (VO2max test). Assessment of the lactate inflection point will also be discussed, which can be applied to sporting and pacing strategies. The anaerobic energy systems will be assessed using a 10s and 30s power test on a bicycle ergometer. Discussion of how these tests relate to fitness and energy system utilisation during exercise will then be discussed.\n\nLab 2: Kinematics of movement: Resistance training\nLinked to VCE Physical Education Unit 4: Training to Improve Performance.Area of Study: How is training implemented effectively to improve performance.\nIn this lab, students will instruct, perform, and analyse several foundational resistance training exercises such as the squat, deadlift and the bench press. Kinematics of movement,ˇincluding force, velocity and power output will be explored using GymAware software. Students will evaluate vertical jump performance of class members using portable force plates, and training variables used to enhance vertical jump height in gym-based settings will be explored. The principles of chronic muscle adaptation in response to resistance training will be discussed as part of this session, with a focus on integrating resistance training into athletes programs to enhance sporting performance.\n\nSession information:\nDates: Monday 17 ?

Discrimination testing will be conducted to determine whether a difference exists between food samples. Descriptive testing will be conducted to determine the nature and intensity of attributes in food samples. Preference testing will be conducted to determine how well food samples are liked. How these tests relate to the science of judging and evaluating the quality of food by the use of the senses (taste, smell, sight, touch and hearing) will then be discussed.Our VCE School Visit Program provides Food Studies students with valuable, practical laboratory experiences that will illustrate and demonstrate the applications of important food industry principles.\n\nLab 2: Healthy and sustainable food from paddock to plate\nLinked to VCE Food Studies Unit 4: Food issues, challenges and futures.Areas of Study: Unit 4: Area of study 1 ? environment and ethics & Area of study 2 ? navigating food information\nIn this hands-on activity, students will track a fresh food item from paddock to plate, incorporating a variety of activities addressing sustainability, food security, food waste, labelling and health. Students will use specialised lab equipment, similar to that used in industry, to determine an item?s quality, then prepare and evaluate a food product using the items that would be labelled as ?second grade?. They will then explore packaging techniques that could be applied to their developed food product and finally, they will use specialised software to determine the products? specific nutrient content and use this along with online tools to explore writing a health claim.\n\nSession information:\nDates: Monday 17 ?

CHS IFTAR 2019,"After the success of last year's Iftar we are going ahead with our second event. Given the opportunity to build bridges between cultures we invite people of all faiths to join this event.ˇStudents undertaking Ramadan are especially asked to invite their friends and families to join them in learning about their culture and sharing in a meal.ˇ\n\nAs two of our school values includeˇCuriosityˇandˇCommunity, what better way to display them than by coming along and meeting families, discovering something new about a different culture or just your own?ˇ\nFAQs\nWho can I bring to the Iftar?\nMembers of your immediate family are invited. Children need to be supervised whilst at Coburg High School, but please bring the kids! This is an informal event and families are encouraged to move about, meet others and enjoy themselves.ˇˇ\nWhat food can I bring to the Iftar?\nIf Ramadan is part of your culture, please bring the traditional foods and drinks that you usually eat and drink. We may have a range of cultures represented: Saudi, Lebanese, Somalian, Pakistani, etc. If an Iftar is new to you, then you may wish to bring any usual dinner foods that can be shared with others. A more creative option is to attempt some Iftar classics. This may mean doing a little Googling or better yet having a conversation or two on Sydney road! Either way, sticking to Halal foods will mean that all can share.\nWhat drinks can I bring to the Iftar?ˇ\nThere are certain drinks that usually only make an appearance during Iftar, otherwise, fruit juices are the go. Apart from being 'Haram' (forbidden) alcohol is not allowed.ˇˇ\nHow much food should I bring to the Iftar?\nBe reasonable. You do not need enough to feed everyone and if everyone brings enough for a family, there will be plenty! If you have a unique drink, something sweet, or an amazing talent in the kitchen - your food might go quicker.\nHow will we share food?ˇ\nTable areas will be set up for people to share. Floor space will also be an option. Students may wish to organise with their friends beforehand who will share with who.ˇˇ\nDo I have to fast before the Iftar?ˇ\nNo! If you are not observing Ramadan then you do not need to fast during the day, but to make the experience more geniune you may wish to. In many Isamic countries, food options are limited during daylight hours of Ramadan, so many Westerners have gone through the experience by default!ˇ\nWill there be microwaves for reheating food?ˇ\nYes, there will be access to microwaves.\nWill there be access to sinks for cleaning?ˇ\nYes, there will be access several sinks?\nShould I bring disposable cups, plates etc. ?ˇ\nAs we have access to sinks, plastic plates or other washable plates would be good.
